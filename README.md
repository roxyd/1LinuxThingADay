Sometimes I don't do this every day (:

Depending on your distro, these may or may not work! I have seen different results from different distros.

Most of the time I'm doing this on Debian 9.

For the most part, they should work though.

If you have any questions or these do not work for you, please open an issue along with the output of cat /etc/*release
